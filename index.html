            simple: "Well, to be honest, I have many friends from school and university, but if I have to choose the most important one, it would definitely be my friend Leo. We have known each other for about eight years now, which feels like a very long time. I remember it so clearly because we first met in the high school cafeteria on a very gloomy and rainy afternoon. I had forgotten my umbrella at home, and I was standing at the school gate, feeling quite miserable because I didn't want to get soaked. Suddenly, a boy walked up to me and quietly asked if I wanted to share his umbrella. That was Leo. We started walking together and realized we shared the same interests in music and gaming. \n\nLeo is important to me because he is always there through thick and thin. For example, last year I had a lot of academic pressure and I actually failed a very important exam. I felt like a total loser. Leo didn't give me a boring speech or tell me 'it’s okay'. Instead, he just came to my house with my favorite bubble tea and we sat in silence for a long time. Then he helped me plan how to study again. He is a man of few words, but he is the most reliable person I know. He always gives me invaluable advice when I’m confused. I guess he is more like a brother to me now. I really cherish our friendship because I know that no matter what happens, he will always stand by me. We still stay in touch every day even though we are in different cities now, and I really hope we can be friends forever.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount my relationship with Leo, a person I consider a kindred spirit and a true cornerstone of my life. Our paths first crossed during a rain-soaked afternoon in high school eight years ago. I remember the rhythmic sound of heavy rain hitting the roof while I stood stranded at the exit. Leo, an introverted classmate I’d barely spoken to, approached me and offered to share his umbrella. That simple act of kindness was the catalyst for a bond that has only strengthened over nearly a decade. \n\nWhat makes Leo indispensable to me is his unwavering support and his rare ability to provide a shoulder to cry on without being overbearing. He is truly a man of few words, yet his actions possess a depth that I find profoundly moving. A perfect illustration of this was during a period of intense self-doubt last year. While others offered cliché encouragement, Leo provided a silent, supportive presence, helping me navigate my academic failures with practical solutions rather than empty words. Our friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and shared loyalty. Despite the occasional personality clash, we’ve managed to stay in touch through every major life transition. He has deeply influenced my perspective on what it means to be a reliable friend. To me, Leo isn't just a companion; he is a pillar of strength who has stood by me through thick and thin. I honestly cannot imagine my journey through my twenties without his steady influence and his invaluable, honest advice."

            simple: "Well, to be honest, I search for information every single day on my phone, but there was one specific time that I will never forget because it was so stressful. It was about three months ago, on a very cold Tuesday night. I was at home, sitting at my desk and preparing for a very important final assignment. I had to finish it by midnight, and it was already 10:30 PM. Suddenly, every light in my house went out—a total blackout. My Wi-Fi stopped working immediately, and I realized my neighborhood had lost power. \n\nI was absolutely panic-stricken because I hadn't finished my research. I only had my smartphone, and the battery was at only 15%. I could see that glowing red battery icon, and I started to have cold sweat. I had to use my mobile data, which was very slow, to search for the specific dates and names I needed for my essay. I was racing against the clock. Usually, I can find things in a few seconds, but that night, I had to sift through many websites to find reliable data while my phone kept warning me about low power. I was typing so fast that my fingers were almost shaking. I needed that information because my whole grade depended on this submission. After about 40 minutes of frantic searching, I finally found what I needed and uploaded my work using my phone. When I finally clicked 'submit', my phone died. I sat there in the dark for a long time, feeling a huge sense of relief. It was a very scary experience, but it taught me to always finish my work earlier and not wait until the last minute.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount a high-pressure situation last semester when I was forced to search for information under incredibly difficult circumstances. It was the eve of my final thesis submission, and I was in the middle of a complex data verification process when a sudden blackout plunged my apartment into absolute darkness. The silence that followed was deafening. My router was dead, and my laptop’s battery was rapidly depleting. I felt a surge of adrenaline, but not the good kind—I was genuinely panic-stricken. \n\nWith a critical deadline looming at midnight, I had to rely entirely on my smartphone’s dwindling battery and a very unstable mobile connection. I was forced to sift through a vast amount of fragmented information on the web to find the specific economic statistics I needed. The contrast between the organized, calm research environment I had earlier that day and this frantic race against the clock was jarring. I remember being hunched over in the pitch-black room, my eyes straining against the harsh blue light of the screen, desperately typing search queries. I had to filter out a lot of irrelevant noise and synthesize the core data points while my phone battery dropped to 5%. This experience was profoundly enlightening; it highlighted our total dependency on digital reliability. I had to be extremely resourceful, using every second wisely. When I finally managed to submit the file, just moments before my phone turned off, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. It was a stark reminder of how indispensable the internet has become, and how vulnerable we are when technology fails us at the most inconvenient moment."

            simple: "Actually, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of all animals, but there is one wild animal that I’ve been really interested in for a long time, and that is the Snow Leopard. I remember it so clearly because I first saw it in a nature documentary on TV when I was about ten years old. I was sitting on my sofa, eating some snacks, and my dad turned on the channel. At first, the screen just showed a lot of grey rocks and snow in the mountains. I thought it was a bit boring, but then, my dad said, 'Wait, look!' Suddenly, a part of the 'rock' started moving, and I realized it was a giant cat. \n\nI was so shocked because I couldn't see it at all before it moved. It has this thick, smoky-grey fur that helps it blend into the background perfectly. It looked like it was wearing an invisibility cloak. That moment really piqued my curiosity. I want to know more about how they survive in such cold and high places without any help from humans. I also want to know more about their tail, because in the video, it looked very long and heavy, and I wonder if they use it like a blanket when they sleep. Actually, I also read that they are an endangered species, so I’m quite worried about them. I want to learn what we can do to protect their natural habitat. If I have the chance in the future, I really want to go to a museum or a research center to see more videos of them. It's just such a mysterious and beautiful creature that I can't stop thinking about it. I guess that’s why I want to learn every little detail about their lives and how they hunt in the silent snow.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount my fascination with the Snow Leopard, a creature often referred to as the 'Ghost of the Mountains' due to its incredibly elusive nature. My obsession began nearly a decade ago while watching a high-definition documentary. I vividly recall a particular scene where the camera focused on a rugged, snowy terrain for almost two minutes. To my untrained eye, it was merely a landscape of static stones and shadows. However, the moment a slight twitch of a tail revealed the majestic predator, I was utterly breathless. It was a masterclass in natural camouflage. \n\nThis striking visual impact is precisely why I’m dying to delve deeper into their world. I’m particularly captivated by their physiological adaptations—specifically, how their oversized paws act as natural snowshoes and how their exceptionally long tails provide balance on sheer, vertical cliffs. Beyond their physical traits, I find their solitary lifestyle in the hostile environment of the Himalayas to be both heroic and profoundly lonely. I want to understand the drive of a solitary apex predator. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about their vulnerable status in the face of climate change. I want to explore the data behind their population trends and the specific conservation efforts being made to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. The idea that such a stealthy, beautiful creature could vanish into the mist forever is a heartbreaking thought. I want to learn more about the scientific methods used to track them, as they are so difficult to spot. For me, the Snow Leopard represents the ultimate mystery of the natural world, and I feel a strong desire to advocate for its protection."

It was such a peaceful atmosphere, and I loved listening to her soft voice. \n\nThe story is basically about a powerful white snake spirit that transforms into a beautiful woman and falls in love with a very kind man named Xu Xian. They get married and start a small business, and for a while, they are extremely happy. However, a mean monk named Fahai thinks their love is wrong because she is not a real human. He tries every trick to separate them and finally traps the lady under a giant pagoda. When I first heard this story as a six-year-old, I felt very angry and even a bit sad. I couldn't understand why the monk wanted to destroy such a beautiful relationship. I remember crying a little bit and asking my grandma why the 'bad guy' won. Now that I’m older, I realize that this story is very symbolic. It’s about fighting for love and facing social prejudice. It’s a huge part of our cultural heritage and it has been passed down through generations. I guess I will tell this story to my own children in the future, just like my grandmother did for me. It’s a truly captivating tale.",
        advanced: "I’d like to recount a cornerstone of Chinese folklore known as 'The Legend of the White Snake'. This captivating tale was first introduced to me by my grandmother as a bedtime story during my early childhood. I recall being utterly mesmerized by her vivid descriptions of misty rain on the Broken Bridge in Hangzhou—a setting that felt almost mythological under her narration. The nostalgic scent of old books in her room combined with her rhythmic storytelling created an atmosphere of pure mystery. \n\nThe narrative centers on a supernatural romance between a white snake spirit, who takes human form, and a mortal man. Their forbidden love, however, is met with fierce opposition from a rigid monk who represents the cold weight of tradition and prejudice. The conflict reaches a tragic climax when the heroine is imprisoned beneath a pagoda, separated from her family for eternity. When I first heard this, it struck a deep emotional resonance within me. As a child, I was heartbroken by the blatant injustice of their separation, but as an adult, I appreciate the story's profound symbolic depth. It is deeply rooted in our culture because it explores the tension between individual desire and social boundaries. The White Snake isn't merely a mythological figure; she is a symbol of sacrifice and the indomitable human spirit. This story has survived for centuries because its moral—that love should transcend the boundaries of species and status—is universal. It remains an iconic piece of our cultural heritage, continuing to inspire countless modern adaptations in film and opera. Listening to it again today reminds me of the power of storytelling to challenge our prejudices."

        simple: "Well, to be honest, I’m not really a professional swimmer, but there is one water sport that has been at the top of my bucket list for a very long time, and that is scuba diving. I’ve been interested in this since I saw a movie about the ocean when I was a teenager. I would really love to try it in a place where the water is crystal clear, like Thailand or the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. I want to see the vibrant coral reefs and all the colorful fish with my own eyes instead of just seeing them on a TV screen. \n\nActually, I think it will be quite difficult and even a bit scary when I first jump into the water. You have to use a lot of heavy equipment, like the oxygen tank and the mask, and you have to learn how to breathe properly underwater, which is not a natural thing for humans to do. So, I will definitely need some professional training and a patient instructor. I might feel a bit panic-stricken at the beginning. However, the main reason I really want to try it is the sense of freedom it offers. I want to feel weightless, almost like I’m flying in a blue universe. Currently, my life in the city is very noisy and busy, so I think diving into the silent underwater world would give me a lot of tranquility. I want to step out of my comfort zone and see what the world looks like under the sea. I guess it will be an exhilarating and unforgettable experience for me. I’m planning to save some money and finally take a diving course next summer holiday.",
        advanced: "A water sport that has occupied the summit of my bucket list for years is scuba diving. Ideally, I’d like to take the plunge in the Great Barrier Reef, a location renowned for its staggering marine biodiversity. The prospect of immersing myself in that vibrant, underwater world is something I find utterly captivating. I’ve always been drawn to the idea of a transition from the chaotic, noisy surface of our daily lives to a silent, deep-blue universe where the only sound you hear is the rhythm of your own breathing. \n\nAdmittedly, scuba diving is not a sport for the faint-hearted. It requires a significant leap of faith and rigorous professional training to master the complex equipment and maintain buoyancy. Learning to breathe through a regulator while navigating an alien environment is a formidable physical and mental challenge. However, that’s precisely why I find it so exhilarating. I crave the sensation of being 'weightless'—experiencing a form of movement that is physically impossible on land. The contrast between my structured, metropolitan life and the unpredictable beauty of the coral reefs is what drives my curiosity. I want to witness firsthand the intricate ecosystems and the breathtaking array of marine life that most people only see in documentaries. For me, scuba diving represents the ultimate way to step out of my comfort zone and explore the unknown. It’s not just about the adrenaline rush; it’s about a profound shift in perspective. To be suspended in the crystal-clear water, surrounded by tranquility and mystery, would be an enlightening experience that I’m certain would stay with me for a lifetime."

        simple: "I’d like to talk about a very interesting building I visited last year, which is the Suzhou Museum. It is located in the old part of Suzhou city, and it was designed by a very famous architect. Actually, I remember it so clearly because the moment I walked in, I felt like I was entering a beautiful painting. The building is not like those tall, modern skyscrapers in Shanghai. Instead, it is quite low and uses a very simple color scheme of black, white, and grey. \n\nThe building looks very unique because it combines traditional Chinese garden styles with modern geometric shapes. For example, the windows are not just squares; they are shaped like diamonds and hexagons. Inside, there is a large courtyard with a small pond and some rocks. When the sun shines, you can see the perfect reflection of the building in the water. It’s used to display ancient Chinese art and historical items, but to be honest, I think the building itself is the most beautiful piece of art there. I find it interesting because it shows how we can keep our traditional culture alive while using modern design. Most modern buildings look the same, but the Suzhou Museum has a very special soul. It feels very quiet and peaceful inside, and it’s a great place to escape from the noisy city life. I spent almost four hours there just taking photos of the shadows and the light. It really changed my idea of what a museum should look like, and I recommend everyone to visit it at least once.",
        advanced: "I’d like to describe the Suzhou Museum, an architectural masterpiece that perfectly encapsulates the fusion of traditional Chinese aesthetics and modern minimalist design. Located in the heart of Suzhou’s historic district, it was designed by the world-renowned architect I.M. Pei. What makes this building so unique is its departure from conventional museum design. Instead of a massive, imposing structure, it features a series of low-rise pavilions that seamlessly blend into the surrounding ancient gardens and white-walled houses. \n\nThe visual impact of the building is striking. It utilizes a monochrome palette—mostly white walls and grey stone—which creates a sophisticated and timeless feel. The use of geometric shapes, such as triangular roofs and hexagonal windows, allows natural light to filter into the galleries in a very poetic way. One of the most interesting features is the outdoor 'water garden'. The pond acts as a giant mirror, creating a stunning reflection of the structures and the carefully placed limestone rocks. This building is not just a space for cultural relics; it’s a dialogue between the past and the present. I find it fascinating because it manages to be cutting-edge without losing its historical soul. The harmony between the sharp, modern lines and the soft, traditional landscape is simply breathtaking. Every time I visit, I’m impressed by how the architect used light and shadow to create such a tranquil atmosphere. It’s a brilliant example of how architecture can respect cultural heritage while embracing the future. For anyone interested in design, it is an absolute must-see."

This might sound strange because most old people have trouble using smartphones, but Grandpa Li is very tech-savvy. He even taught me how to use some professional photo-editing software last month! He also has a green thumb, so sometimes I help him water his flowers and he tells me fascinating stories about his life as a teacher in the countryside. I think he is interesting because he really breaks the stereotype of old people. He is a lifelong learner who is always trying to keep up with the times. For example, he recently started learning how to play the guitar by watching videos on the internet. He is always so optimistic and full of curiosity about the world. Whenever I feel stressed about my studies, I go to talk to him, and his stories always make me feel more relaxed. He has so much life experience, but he is never boring or bossy.

We first crossed paths a few years ago in our apartment building’s shared garden, and since then, he has become a mentor and a dear friend to me. \n\nWhat truly sets him apart is his insatiable curiosity and the fact that he is incredibly tech-savvy. While many of his peers struggle with the digital age, Grandpa Li is often seen experimenting with the latest gadgets or even coding simple programs on his laptop. Our interactions usually involve a fascinating blend of traditional wisdom and modern innovation; one afternoon he might be teaching me the intricacies of organic gardening, and the next, we might be discussing the latest trends in artificial intelligence. I find him immensely interesting because he consistently challenges the negative stereotypes associated with aging. He is a lifelong learner who refuses to be left behind by the rapid pace of modern society. His sense of humor is infectious, and his fascinating stories from his decades as an educator offer me a profound perspective on life’s challenges. He is down-to-earth yet deeply knowledgeable, always offering inspiring advice without being overbearing. Knowing him has been an enlightening experience, as he demonstrates that age is merely a number and that a vibrant mind can remain curious and engaged forever. He is, without a doubt, the most inspiring senior citizen I’ve ever met."

I’d also love to visit one of his factories to see how the robots work. The reason I want to meet him is that I find his ambition and resilience very inspirational. Most people are afraid of failure, but he once said that 'failure is an option'—if things are not failing, you are not innovating enough. That really changed my mindset about my own mistakes in school. He is a very charismatic person who truly wants to change the world and make life multi-planetary.

Instead, I’d love to engage in an insightful discussion regarding the future of human civilization and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. I’m particularly curious about his mindset during the early days of SpaceX when he was on the brink of bankruptcy. I’d love to understand the resilience required to stay the course when the entire world is betting against you. The reason I’m so drawn to him is his unique perspective on failure. He treats every setback as a data point, which is an incredibly empowering way to tackle challenges. While he is certainly a controversial figure, his charismatic leadership and his ability to inspire millions to 'think big' are undeniable. I’d love to witness his daily routine firsthand, as he is the ultimate man of action. Meeting him would be a transformative experience for me, as it would provide a rare glimpse into the mind of someone who isn't just living in the world, but actively redesigning it for future generations.

It was a long-planned trip, and I spent about three days exploring the mountains and lakes. I remember it so clearly because the moment I stepped into the park, I felt like I was walking into a fairy tale. \n\nThe place is famous for its colorful lakes. The water is so crystal clear that you can see the dead trees at the bottom, which have been there for hundreds of years. The colors change from turquoise to deep blue depending on the sunlight. Around the lakes, there are thick forests and snow-capped mountains in the distance. It’s truly a feast for the eyes. I think it is a place of natural beauty because everything feels so pristine and untouched. Unlike the busy city where we live, the air there is incredibly fresh, and the only sound you can hear is the wind and the waterfalls. Sitting by the mirror-like lake made me feel so peaceful. I took so many photos, but to be honest, no camera can truly capture the serenity of that place. It’s a perfect spot to escape the hustle and bustle of modern life and just enjoy the magic of nature.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount my visit to Jiuzhai Valley, a breathtaking geological wonder that I consider the pinnacle of natural beauty in China. Last October, I had the opportunity to travel there during the peak of the autumn season. As I entered the valley, I was immediately struck by the sheer scale of the landscape and the vibrant colors of the high-altitude lakes. \n\nThe scenery is characterized by turquoise waters that are so transparent they create a perfect reflection of the surrounding lush vegetation and snow-capped peaks. One of the most captivating features is the 'Five Color Lake,' where the mineral deposits create a spectacular rainbow effect under the water. It’s an environment that feels almost sacred in its purity. I believe Jiuzhai Valley is the definition of natural beauty because of its harmonious balance; the dramatic waterfalls contrast beautifully with the absolute serenity of the still lakes. It’s a rare example of a well-preserved, pristine environment that remains largely untouched by industrialization. For me, escaping the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life to witness such a panoramic view was a transformative experience. It provided a much-needed sense of tranquility and reminded me of the importance of nature conservation. The memory of standing by those crystal-clear waters is something I will cherish for a lifetime."

            simple: "Well, to be honest, I have many friends from school and university, but if I have to choose the most important one, it would definitely be my friend Leo. We have known each other for about eight years now, which feels like a very long time. I remember it so clearly because we first met in the high school cafeteria on a very gloomy and rainy afternoon. I had forgotten my umbrella at home, and I was standing at the school gate, feeling quite miserable because I didn't want to get soaked. Suddenly, a boy walked up to me and quietly asked if I wanted to share his umbrella. That was Leo. We started walking together and realized we shared the same interests in music and gaming. \n\nLeo is important to me because he is always there through thick and thin. For example, last year I had a lot of academic pressure and I actually failed a very important exam. I felt like a total loser. Leo didn't give me a boring speech or tell me 'it’s okay'. Instead, he just came to my house with my favorite bubble tea and we sat in silence for a long time. Then he helped me plan how to study again. He is a man of few words, but he is the most reliable person I know. He always gives me invaluable advice when I’m confused. I guess he is more like a brother to me now. I really cherish our friendship because I know that no matter what happens, he will always stand by me. We still stay in touch every day even though we are in different cities now, and I really hope we can be friends forever.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount my relationship with Leo, a person I consider a kindred spirit and a true cornerstone of my life. Our paths first crossed during a rain-soaked afternoon in high school eight years ago. I remember the rhythmic sound of heavy rain hitting the roof while I stood stranded at the exit. Leo, an introverted classmate I’d barely spoken to, approached me and offered to share his umbrella. That simple act of kindness was the catalyst for a bond that has only strengthened over nearly a decade. \n\nWhat makes Leo indispensable to me is his unwavering support and his rare ability to provide a shoulder to cry on without being overbearing. He is truly a man of few words, yet his actions possess a depth that I find profoundly moving. A perfect illustration of this was during a period of intense self-doubt last year. While others offered cliché encouragement, Leo provided a silent, supportive presence, helping me navigate my academic failures with practical solutions rather than empty words. Our friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and shared loyalty. Despite the occasional personality clash, we’ve managed to stay in touch through every major life transition. He has deeply influenced my perspective on what it means to be a reliable friend. To me, Leo isn't just a companion; he is a pillar of strength who has stood by me through thick and thin. I honestly cannot imagine my journey through my twenties without his steady influence and his invaluable, honest advice."

            simple: "Well, to be honest, I search for information every single day on my phone, but there was one specific time that I will never forget because it was so stressful. It was about three months ago, on a very cold Tuesday night. I was at home, sitting at my desk and preparing for a very important final assignment. I had to finish it by midnight, and it was already 10:30 PM. Suddenly, every light in my house went out—a total blackout. My Wi-Fi stopped working immediately, and I realized my neighborhood had lost power. \n\nI was absolutely panic-stricken because I hadn't finished my research. I only had my smartphone, and the battery was at only 15%. I could see that glowing red battery icon, and I started to have cold sweat. I had to use my mobile data, which was very slow, to search for the specific dates and names I needed for my essay. I was racing against the clock. Usually, I can find things in a few seconds, but that night, I had to sift through many websites to find reliable data while my phone kept warning me about low power. I was typing so fast that my fingers were almost shaking. I needed that information because my whole grade depended on this submission. After about 40 minutes of frantic searching, I finally found what I needed and uploaded my work using my phone. When I finally clicked 'submit', my phone died. I sat there in the dark for a long time, feeling a huge sense of relief. It was a very scary experience, but it taught me to always finish my work earlier and not wait until the last minute.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount a high-pressure situation last semester when I was forced to search for information under incredibly difficult circumstances. It was the eve of my final thesis submission, and I was in the middle of a complex data verification process when a sudden blackout plunged my apartment into absolute darkness. The silence that followed was deafening. My router was dead, and my laptop’s battery was rapidly depleting. I felt a surge of adrenaline, but not the good kind—I was genuinely panic-stricken. \n\nWith a critical deadline looming at midnight, I had to rely entirely on my smartphone’s dwindling battery and a very unstable mobile connection. I was forced to sift through a vast amount of fragmented information on the web to find the specific economic statistics I needed. The contrast between the organized, calm research environment I had earlier that day and this frantic race against the clock was jarring. I remember being hunched over in the pitch-black room, my eyes straining against the harsh blue light of the screen, desperately typing search queries. I had to filter out a lot of irrelevant noise and synthesize the core data points while my phone battery dropped to 5%. This experience was profoundly enlightening; it highlighted our total dependency on digital reliability. I had to be extremely resourceful, using every second wisely. When I finally managed to submit the file, just moments before my phone turned off, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. It was a stark reminder of how indispensable the internet has become, and how vulnerable we are when technology fails us at the most inconvenient moment."

            simple: "Actually, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of all animals, but there is one wild animal that I’ve been really interested in for a long time, and that is the Snow Leopard. I remember it so clearly because I first saw it in a nature documentary on TV when I was about ten years old. I was sitting on my sofa, eating some snacks, and my dad turned on the channel. At first, the screen just showed a lot of grey rocks and snow in the mountains. I thought it was a bit boring, but then, my dad said, 'Wait, look!' Suddenly, a part of the 'rock' started moving, and I realized it was a giant cat. \n\nI was so shocked because I couldn't see it at all before it moved. It has this thick, smoky-grey fur that helps it blend into the background perfectly. It looked like it was wearing an invisibility cloak. That moment really piqued my curiosity. I want to know more about how they survive in such cold and high places without any help from humans. I also want to know more about their tail, because in the video, it looked very long and heavy, and I wonder if they use it like a blanket when they sleep. Actually, I also read that they are an endangered species, so I’m quite worried about them. I want to learn what we can do to protect their natural habitat. If I have the chance in the future, I really want to go to a museum or a research center to see more videos of them. It's just such a mysterious and beautiful creature that I can't stop thinking about it. I guess that’s why I want to learn every little detail about their lives and how they hunt in the silent snow.",
            advanced: "I’d like to recount my fascination with the Snow Leopard, a creature often referred to as the 'Ghost of the Mountains' due to its incredibly elusive nature. My obsession began nearly a decade ago while watching a high-definition documentary. I vividly recall a particular scene where the camera focused on a rugged, snowy terrain for almost two minutes. To my untrained eye, it was merely a landscape of static stones and shadows. However, the moment a slight twitch of a tail revealed the majestic predator, I was utterly breathless. It was a masterclass in natural camouflage. \n\nThis striking visual impact is precisely why I’m dying to delve deeper into their world. I’m particularly captivated by their physiological adaptations—specifically, how their oversized paws act as natural snowshoes and how their exceptionally long tails provide balance on sheer, vertical cliffs. Beyond their physical traits, I find their solitary lifestyle in the hostile environment of the Himalayas to be both heroic and profoundly lonely. I want to understand the drive of a solitary apex predator. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about their vulnerable status in the face of climate change. I want to explore the data behind their population trends and the specific conservation efforts being made to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. The idea that such a stealthy, beautiful creature could vanish into the mist forever is a heartbreaking thought. I want to learn more about the scientific methods used to track them, as they are so difficult to spot. For me, the Snow Leopard represents the ultimate mystery of the natural world, and I feel a strong desire to advocate for its protection."

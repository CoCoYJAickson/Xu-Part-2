I was struggling with a computer project, and he just sat down and helped me out. \n\nWhat makes him important is how he supports me. I remember one time I failed an important interview. I was so upset that I stayed in my room all day. Jerry didn't just say 'it's okay'. He came to my place with my favorite food and stayed with me for hours. We didn't talk much, but his presence made me feel much better. He is the person I can always count on when life gets tough.",
            advanced: "I'd like to talk about Jerry, who is essentially my 'kindred spirit'. Our friendship dates back to a chaotic finals week three years ago. I vividly remember sitting in a corner of the library, staring at a coding error for six hours, feeling completely defeated. Jerry, who was a total stranger then, noticed my frustration and struck up a conversation. \n\nHe is incredibly important to me because he acts as my 'pillar of strength'. A perfect example of this was when I faced a personal crisis last year. While others offered cliché advice, Jerry provided a listening ear and unwavering support. He has this unique ability to sense my mood without me saying a word. This emotional connection, combined with our shared passion for technology, makes our bond indestructible. He isn't just a fair-weather friend; he is the backbone of my social circle."

It looked so cool with its thick grey fur. \n\nI really want to know more about its camouflage. In the documentary, the camera was pointing at a pile of rocks, and for a long time, I thought there was nothing there. Then, suddenly, a rock started moving, and I realized it was a leopard! I was so shocked. I want to know how they can hide so perfectly. Also, because they are endangered, I want to learn how we can protect their homes in the mountains. They are very mysterious and I want to see how they survive in the cold snow without any help.",
            advanced: "The animal that has always piqued my curiosity is the Snow Leopard, often dubbed the 'Ghost of the Mountains'. My fascination began a decade ago while watching a nature documentary. I remember staring at the screen, squinting my eyes to find the leopard on a rocky cliff. It was a 'now you see me, now you don't' moment—the animal was a master of disguise, blending perfectly into the grey stones. \n\nWhat I'm dying to understand is the physiological mechanism behind their camouflage. How does their fur pattern adapt so seamlessly to the hostile environment? Furthermore, I'm interested in their solitary lifestyle. Living as an apex predator in the silent, freezing Himalayas sounds both majestic and incredibly lonely. I want to delve into the conservation efforts as well. Knowing that such a stealthy and beautiful creature is vulnerable to climate change makes me want to advocate for their protection. They represent the mystery of nature that we have yet to fully decode."

My laptop died, and my room was pitch black. \n\nI was very worried because I hadn't finished my notes. I used my phone to search for the historical events on a website. Before the power cut, I was taking my time, but after that, I was racing against the clock because my phone battery was low. I had to find the most important points very quickly. It was very stressful but the information I found helped me pass the exam the next day. This taught me that having a smartphone with a good connection is a life-saver.",

My router went dead, and I was panic-stricken because I needed to verify some last-minute statistics. \n\nWith only 15% battery left on my smartphone, I had to sift through a vast amount of fragmented information on the web. I switched from traditional search engines to an AI assistant to streamline the process. The contrast between my calm, organized research earlier that day and this desperate race against the clock was intense. I was frantically typing queries, hoping for clarity amidst the technical glitch. This experience was quite enlightening; it made me realize how much we depend on the reliability of our infrastructure, and how AI can be a total game-changer when you need filtered, accurate data under extreme urgency."
